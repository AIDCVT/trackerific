 * Added support for USPS City / State API for looking up a city and state by
its zipcode.
 * Renamed required_options to required_parameters. (Makes much more sense.)
 * Added a lot more specs for more code coverage.
 * Changed the way that Details and Events are initialized. Using options
instead of parameters.
 * Removed doc folder from git, since it is automatically generated with yard
